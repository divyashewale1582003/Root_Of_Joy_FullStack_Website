        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">
        Rose bushes (Rosa spp.) are shrubs best known for their fragrant blossoms 
        of red, pink, apricot, yellow, white, and variations. 
        Some rose bushes stand erect, others trail, and a few
         even climb. Their woody stems are studded with sharp thorns.

         <h2>How to take care of Rose-plant</h2>
         <ol>
            <li style="font-weight: bold">Water:<p>Typically, it is best to water roses twice a weekâ€”and water them thoroughly.
                Avoid late-evening watering, which can foster powdery mildew, a very common disease among rose plants.
            </p></li>

            <li style="font-weight: bold">Temperature and Humidity:<p>Roses can survive periodic weather extremes, but they prefer temperatures between 60 and 70 degrees 
                Fahrenheit and a humidity range between 60% and 70%.</p></li>

            <li style="font-weight: bold">Light:<p>Rose plant requires full exposure to the sun.</p></li>

            <li style="font-weight: bold">Fertilizer:<p>A good rule of thumb for beginners is to feed roses monthly with a 10-10-10 rose fertilizer. Start feeding them when they 
                are actively growing in spring, coinciding with pruning time.</p></li>
