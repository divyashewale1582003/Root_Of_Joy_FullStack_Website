        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">
        ZZ plants are known as flowering plants, but they very rarely produce flowers. Instead, the plant is known for its wide, dark green leaves. They can make great desk plants or floor plants and can grow quite tall if left alone. 
        The leaves can be 40-60 cm long.
