        <h2>Information</h2>
        The black-eyed Susan vine (Thunbergia alata) is a tropical perennial that is often grown as an annual flowering vine.
        The flowers look daisy-like at a distance, with five overlapping, solid-colored petals surrounding a brownish-purple center tube. The medium green leaves are a little coarse and grow opposite one anotherâ€”they can be either heart-shaped or have a lance-like arrowhead shape.
